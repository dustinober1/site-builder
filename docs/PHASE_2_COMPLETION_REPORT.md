## What Changed: Files Modified

### 1. **Toolbar.js** (+15 lines)
**Change**: Added 3 new block type buttons
```
Added to blockTypes array:
- { type: 'knowledge-check', label: 'Knowledge Check', icon: '‚úì' }
- { type: 'advanced-question', label: 'Advanced Question', icon: '‚ùì' }
- { type: 'branching-scenario', label: 'Branching Scenario', icon: 'üîÄ' }
```
**Impact**: Users can now click these buttons to add new block types

---

### 2. **ContentBlock.js** (+35 lines)
**Change**: Enhanced renderPreview() with 3 new switch cases
**Cases Added**:
- `case 'knowledge-check'`: Shows question + options list
- `case 'advanced-question'`: Shows question + answer excerpt
- `case 'branching-scenario'`: Shows scenario + decision paths

**Impact**: Each block type displays appropriate preview while editing

---

### 3. **ContentBlock.css** (+30 lines)
**Change**: Added preview styling for new block types
**Classes Added**:
- `.preview-knowledge-check`
- `.preview-advanced-question`
- `.preview-branching-scenario`
- Plus styling for nested lists and options

**Impact**: New blocks display with proper styling and visual hierarchy

---

### 4. **PropertiesPanel.js** (+150 lines)
**Change**: Added 3 complete editing forms with dynamic field management

**Knowledge Check Form**:
- Question textarea
- Options array container (add/remove buttons)
- Correct answer selector
- Feedback textarea

**Advanced Question Form**:
- Question textarea
- Answer textarea
- Explanation textarea

**Branching Scenario Form**:
- Scenario textarea
- Paths array container (add/remove buttons)

---

### 6. **Editor.js** (+40 lines)
**Change**: Enhanced handleAddBlock() with type-specific initialization

**Initialization Logic**:
```javascript
switch(type) {
  case 'knowledge-check':
    // Initialize with question, 4 options, correct answer, feedback
    
  case 'advanced-question':
    // Initialize with question, answer, explanation
    
  case 'branching-scenario':
    // Initialize with scenario, 2 default paths
}
```

**Impact**: New blocks create with sensible defaults ready to edit

---

## No Changes Required

‚úÖ **Canvas.js**: Already has optimal `overflow-y: auto` scrolling
‚úÖ **Canvas.css**: Scrolling already configured
‚úÖ **Existing blocks**: Fully backward compatible
‚úÖ **Auto-save mechanism**: Works perfectly with all new types
