**Phase**: Phase 2 (Advanced Content Blocks)  
**Date Completed**: Current Session  
**Error Status**: 0 errors across all files

---

## What Was Built

Your Site Builder now supports **3 powerful new interactive content block types** that make courses more engaging:

### 1. **Knowledge Check Blocks** ‚úì
Multiple-choice questions to test learner comprehension immediately after content.

**User Creates**:
- A question ("What is the capital of France?")
- 4 answer options
- Marks which is correct
- Adds feedback for learner guidance

**Learner Experiences**:
- Sees question with clear options
- Gets immediate feedback on their answer
- Learns which answer is correct

**Use Cases**:
- After each lesson topic
- To prevent learners from progressing without understanding
- As quick comprehension checks
- For formative assessment (non-graded feedback)

**Example**: A safety training course might ask "Which of these is NOT a fire safety measure?" to reinforce key concepts.

---

### 2. **Advanced Question Blocks** ‚ùì
Open-ended questions that prompt deeper thinking and critical analysis.

**User Creates**:
- A complex question ("How would you handle a customer complaint about product quality?")
- A reference answer (guidance for what learners should consider)
- An explanation of why this approach matters

**Learner Experiences**:
- Sees a thought-provoking question
- Has space to write their own answer
- Can view reference answer and explanation
- Reflects on how their answer compares

**Use Cases**:
- Scenario-based learning
- Critical thinking exercises
- Discussion prompts
- Case study analysis
- Problem-solving challenges

**Example**: A business ethics course might ask "Describe an ethical dilemma you've faced and how you resolved it" with reference answers showing strong reasoning patterns.

---

### 3. **Branching Scenario Blocks** üîÄ
Interactive decision-making scenarios where each choice leads to different outcomes.

**User Creates**:
- A scenario description ("You're managing a project and your team requests more time")
- Multiple decision paths:
  - Choice 1: "Grant the extension" ‚Üí Outcome
  - Choice 2: "Stick to the deadline" ‚Üí Outcome
  - Choice 3: "Negotiate alternatives" ‚Üí Outcome

**Learner Experiences**:
- Reads a realistic scenario
- Makes a decision
- Immediately sees consequences
- Can optionally explore other paths to compare

**Use Cases**:
- Soft skills training (leadership, communication)
- Decision-making simulations
- Conflict resolution scenarios
- Customer service training
- Compliance/ethics training

**Example**: A leadership training course might present "A team member missed a deadline. What do you do?" with 3 paths showing different outcomes.

## How It All Works

### For Course Creators

1. **Adding Blocks**:
   - Click toolbar button for the desired type
   - Block appears with default structure
   - Properties panel opens for editing

2. **Editing Content**:
   - Knowledge Check: Fill in question, options, select correct answer, add feedback
   - Advanced Question: Enter question, reference answer, explanation

  feedback: "Correct! Photosynthesis is how plants convert light to energy."
}
```

**Advanced Question Block**:

  scenario: "Your project is delayed. The client is upset. What do you do?",
  paths: [
    {
      choice: "Be honest about the delay",
      outcome: "Client appreciates transparency. You rebuild trust and create realistic timeline."
    },
    {
      choice: "Blame external factors",
      outcome: "Client feels you're making excuses. Trust is damaged. Client becomes more skeptical."
    },
    {

## Feature Details

### Knowledge Check - Complete Guide

**When to Use**:
- After important concepts (every 3-5 minutes of content)
- To prevent skipping critical material
- For compliance training (must verify understanding)
- As pre-assessment tools

**Best Practices**:
- Keep questions clear and specific
- Avoid "trick" questions (test understanding, not reading ability)
- Provide helpful feedback regardless of answer
- Use realistic scenarios in questions
- Avoid making all options similar length
- Test with actual learners if possible

**Interaction Flow**:
```
1. Learner reads question
2. Learner reviews 4 options
3. Learner clicks option
4. System shows: "Correct! [Feedback]" or "Not quite. The answer is [option]. [Feedback]"
5. Learner continues to next block
```

**Learner Psychology**:
- Immediate feedback motivates
- Small wins build confidence
- Explanations prevent frustration
- Variety in formats prevents boredom

**Example Template**:
```
Q: After applying this procedure, what should you verify?
a) The tool is clean ‚Üê CORRECT
b) The area is warm
c) Your hands are dry
d) The instructions are visible

Feedback: Correct! A clean tool ensures accuracy. Always verify cleanliness before use.
```

### Advanced Question - Complete Guide

**When to Use**:
- For complex topics requiring synthesis
- In capstone sections
- For reflective learning
- When learners need to apply concepts
- In professional development

**Best Practices**:
- Start with clear scenario or context
- Ask open-ended questions (avoid yes/no)
- Provide enough space for thinking
- Give reference answers showing reasoning
- Explain why the approach matters
- Consider multiple valid approaches

**Interaction Flow**:
```
1. Learner reads question + context
2. Learner thinks through their answer
3. Learner types response (or just reads)
4. Learner clicks "View Reference Answer"
5. Learner sees model answer + explanation
6. Learner reflects on comparison
7. Learner continues with course
```

**Learner Psychology**:
- Space to think improves retention
- Model answers provide "scaffolding"
- Explanations deepen understanding
- Self-reflection increases engagement

**Example Template**:
```
Q: You've finished the training on conflict resolution. Describe a recent conflict you experienced. 
   How would you handle it differently now?

Reference Answer:
- Identify the core issue (not the symptom)
- Listen to understand the other perspective
- Propose win-win solutions
- Follow up afterward to ensure resolution

Explanation:
This approach works because it addresses root causes rather than symptoms. By listening first,
you build trust. Proposing multiple solutions increases chance of acceptance.
```

### Branching Scenario - Complete Guide

**When to Use**:
- Soft skills (leadership, communication, customer service)
- Decision-making training
- Compliance/ethics scenarios
- Situational judgment tests
- Role-playing alternatives

**Best Practices**:
- Create realistic scenarios from actual situations
- Show meaningful consequences for each choice
- Avoid obvious "right" and "wrong" answers when possible
- 2-5 paths is ideal (more is overwhelming)
- Make outcomes concrete and specific
- Show both positive and negative consequences

**Interaction Flow**:
```
1. Learner reads scenario
2. Learner understands the decision point
3. Learner clicks first choice
4. Learner sees outcome immediately
5. Learner can optionally try other choices
6. Learner learns through comparison
7. Learner continues with course
```

**Learner Psychology**:
- Immediate consequences create powerful learning
- Exploration feels safe (it's just a course)
- Comparing paths deepens understanding
- Realistic scenarios increase relevance
- Seeing consequences prevents real-world mistakes

**Example Template**:
```
Scenario:
You're a team lead. A high-performer just told you they're looking at other jobs because 
they feel stuck. Your company won't give raises this year. What do you do?

Choice 1: "I understand. Have you considered these internal opportunities?"
Outcome: They explore other roles, find growth path, decide to stay. Team stability maintained.

Choice 2: "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find what you're looking for."
Outcome: They feel unsupported. They leave. You lose a key team member and face disruption.

Choice 3: "Let me talk to HR about creative compensation options."
Outcome: You explore stock options, flexible schedule, training budget. They see you advocate for them. They stay.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Options not appearing in Knowledge Check  
**Solution**: Make sure you clicked "Add Option" button to add more. Default has 4 options.

**Issue**: Branching Scenario paths disappeared  
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Reload page - content is auto-saved.

**Issue**: Changes not auto-saving  
**Solution**: Check if "‚úì Auto-saved" indicator appears. If not, verify localStorage is enabled in browser.

**Issue**: Canvas not scrolling smoothly  
**Solution**: This is normal - canvas uses smooth scrolling. Try with mouse wheel for best experience.

**Issue**: Form fields seem frozen  
**Solution**: Click directly in the textarea/input to focus. Then type. If still frozen, try another block.
